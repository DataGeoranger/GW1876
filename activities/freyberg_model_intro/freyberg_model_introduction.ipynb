    "### We have recreated a MODFLOW model that was originally created by David Freyberg at Stanford University in the late 1980s. The  model is a 2-dimensional MODFLOW model with 1 layer,  40 rows, and 20 columns.  The model has 2 stress periods: an initial steady-state stress period used for calibration, and a 5-year transient stress period.  The calibration period uses the recharge and well flux of Freyberg(1988); the forecast stress period uses 25% less recharge and 25% more pumping to represent future drought conditions for a forecast period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The inverse problem has 12 head observations, measured at the end of the steady-state calibration period.  The forecasts of interest include the sw-gw exchange flux during the forecast stress periods (observations named and ``rivflux_fore``), and the water level in well cell 6 located at row 28 column 5 at the end of the stress periods (observations named ```fr03c16``` and ```fr04c9```) and `travel_time` from MODPATH.  The forecasts are included in the Jacobian matrix as zero-weight observations. \n",
