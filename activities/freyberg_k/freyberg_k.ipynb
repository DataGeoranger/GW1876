    "Freyberg (1988) was notable for the discussing what is often called \"point calibration\" and \"overfitting\". It is a heterogenous 2D areal (1-layer) model that is a step up in complexity from our xsec model. Recall it looks like this, as shown in the original Freyberg (1988) paper on the left, and a Groundwater Vistas version on the right (from the file in the GW_Vistas subdirectory).   \n",

    "As we discussed in our first notebook, one way to get to an optimal model is to start simple and add complexity. To do this righte we need to add our forecasts first along with the calibration targets, and look at both as more model complexity is added.  One of the findings of the Freyberg (1988) model is that some students made their model too complex, which diminished its performance for the prediction of interest. Starting simple will keep us out of danger (at least for this notebook). \n",
