    "# Evaluating what happens when using Parameter Estimation on 2 parameters:  Plotting the objective function response surface\n",
    "\n",
    "Pages 400-401 of Anderson et al. (2015) start setting out the approach for how parameter estimation finds a best fit.  It does it by distilling all the metrics of fit into a single number, which then it minimizes.  This single number is called the \"measurement objective function\", often given the symbol Phi, and reflects the residual between the observed and simulated value.  Because residuals can be positive or negative, we square them to make sure the residuals are positive and do not offset each other.  Finally, we typically hold fitting some observations to be higher priority than others; we express this using weights to emphasize or de-emphasize a residual.  Here is the equation for our cross-section xsec model, where we only have heads as observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"SOSWR_eq_AW&H2015.png\" style=\"float: center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "where Phi is the \"sum of squared weighted residuals\" that we look to minimize, *whi* is the weight for the ith head observation; *hm* is the measured (observed) head target; *hs* is the simulated head; and n is the number of observations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate Phi using model output for a range of two parameters that affect calibration. The plot of two parameters and the resulting Phi is called a response surface. This response surface is like a topographic contour map because it shows three dimensions in two dimensions.  Here is an idealized plot taken from figure 9.10a in Anderson et al. (2015):\n",
