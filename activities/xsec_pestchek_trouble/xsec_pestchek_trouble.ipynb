    "PESTCHEK will be a handy lifesaver because, as you've seen, the PEST control file has many variables.  Most don't need to be touched, but when working in the file they can get inadvertently touched.  Likewise, it can be hard to ensure that what was tweaked is entirely correct, and/or correctly rippled elsewhere in the PEST input (e.g., the counters near the top of the file). PESTCHEK also looks at template files and instruction files making sure there is perfect match between what you say is a parameter (so should be in a template file) and an observation (so should be in an instruction file) is represented in the PEST files.  So for your PEST runs, and for those sent to you, PESTCHEK is the first line of defense. \n",
