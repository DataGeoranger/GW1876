\begin{description}
\item [Parameters] Variable input values for models, typically representing system properties and forcings. Values to be estimated in the history matching process
\item [Observation] Measured system state values. These values are used to compare with model outputs collocated in space and time. The term is often used to mean \emph{both} field measurements and outputs from the model. 
\item [Forecasts] Model outputs for which field observations are not available. Typically these values are simulated under an uncertain future condition.
\item [Phi]
\item [Residuals]
\item [FOSM]
\item [Gaussian (multivariate)]
\item [Weight Covariance matrix (correlation matrix)]
\item [Parametric uncertainty]
\item [Measurement noise]
\item [Structural (model) error]
\item [Monte Carlo Ensemble]
\item [Posterior (multivariate distro)]
\item [Prior (multivariate distro)]
\item [Likelihood (multivariate distro)]
