\title{Applied Groundwater Model Calibration and Uncertainty Analysis Curriculum }

\author{Jeremy T. White, Michael N. Fienen,  and Randall J. Hunt }

\date{Feb 2020}

\maketitle

\textbf{MONDAY}
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Introductions of students/instructors --- JDub} Goals for
the week and framing 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The mechanics and theory 
\item Learning by doing 
\item Please speak up! Everyone learns from discussion 
\item Work in pairs  !!!
\item Python, GUIs, and all that 
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Logistics and airing of the IT grievances --- JDub}: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Did everyone get the software installed? 
\item Pull the class from github and make a copy 
\item Brief Git tutorial (including modeling workflows with Git)
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Regression --- MNF} Notebook as simple machine learning

\item \textbf{Bayes Theorem and Inference --- MNF} Adding context to regression 

\item \textbf{RRR --- JDub} Aspirational goals of groundwater modeling

\item \textbf{Demo with EAA model --- JDub} Edwards Aquifer modeling workflow

\item \textbf{Freyberg model --- MNF} Introduce the enhanced Freyberg model.
Show "truth" observations, water budget, etc


\item \textbf{Connecting a model to PEST++ --- RJH} Steady-state GUI Style - how can you connect a model to PEST with a GUI.

%\item\textbf{run iES and viz in Excel and python --- RJH} All defaults, uncertainty from the start



\textbf{TUESDAY}

\item \textbf{Adding transience to a model notebook --- JDub/MNF}. flopy/python review

\item \textbf{Intro to pyemu --- JDub/MNF}

\item \textbf{Geostatistics, the Prior and pilot points --- MNF} Variograms as a basis for interpolation, the use of factors, \textquotedblleft spatially weighted averaging\textquotedblright , all this wrapped up in Kriging. Pilot points as a dimension reduction (``parameterization'') device.

\item \textbf{Setup pest interface notebook --- JDub} Automating the construction of the PEST interface and associated components.  

\item \textbf{Transient modeling discussion --- RJH} The allure and pitfalls
of transient modeling, esp for history-matching.

\item \textbf{Processing obs and setting weights notebook --- JDub}.  Discussion about observation processing to align with model stress periods and assigning meaningful weights.

\textbf{WEDNESDAY}

\item \textbf{Prior Monte Carlo --- JDub/RJH}. Mechanics of parallel run mgmt - including giveup setting, pestpp-swp and starting a worker manually.  The relative safety of Prior Monte Carlo.  Learning from Prior Monte Carlo. Foreshadowing of prior-data conflict

\item \textbf{GLM --- MNF} Derivation of the Gauss-Levenberg-Marquardt
Algorithm maths --- walking through the PDF with $\lambda$ images

\item \textbf{PESTPP-GLM part 1 notebook: fill a base Jacobian --- RJH}. Start this then cover FOSM theory

\item \textbf{FOSM theory (including ident and sens) and dataworth --- MNF} FOSM as an alternative to MC (rejection sampling). PEST lingo = PREDUNC/GENLINPRED.  Posterior residual-based weight adjust and implications.

\item \textbf{Dataworth notebook --- JDub} 

\item \textbf{Singular Value Decomposition --- MNF} Algorithm at the heart of alot of what we are doing.  Super parameters (parameter space reduction).

\item \textbf{PESTPP-GLM part 2 notebook --- JDub}. Actual parameter adjustments (scary!) and 
posterior parameter and forecast estimation. {change the forecasts and do more dataworth}


\textbf{THURSDAY}

\item \textbf{Ensemble-based modeling analyses --- JDub}. Considerations for using ensembles.
parameter statistical moment changes instead of "sensitivity analysis".  Visualizing 
obs vs sim. more comprehensive pest interface.  

\item \textbf{PESTPP-IES notebook part 1 --- MNF}.  Vanilla IES, prior-data conflict and total error covariance workflows.

\item \textbf{Localization and PESTPP-IES notebook part 2 --- JDub}.  using varies forms of localization

\item \textbf{Live Demo: ensemble-based scenario modeling --- JDub} Create a 
scenario model, setup a pest interface and run prior or posterior Monte Carlo (pestpp-swp)

\textbf{FRIDAY}

\item \textbf{Stuff we didn't get to yet}

\item \textbf{Mgmt opt under uncertainty --- MNF}: examples from SIRE and Little Plover

\item \textbf{PESTPP-OPT notebook --- JDub}: running PESTPP-OPT on the freyberg model to optimize GW use subject to SW-GW exchange constraints.

\item \textbf{Discussion and wrap up --- ALL}

\end{enumerate}
