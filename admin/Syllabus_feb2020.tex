\date{Feb 2020}

\maketitle

\textbf{MONDAY}
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Introductions of students/instructors --- JDub} Goals for
the week and framing 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The mechanics and theory 
\item Learning by doing 
\item Please speak up! Everyone learns from discussion 
\item Work in pairs  !!!
\item Python, GUIs, and all that 
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Logistics and airing of the IT grievances --- JDub}: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Did everyone get the software installed? 
\item Pull the class from github and make a copy 
\item Brief Git tutorial (including modeling workflows with Git)
\end{enumerate}

\item \textbf{RRR --- JDub} Long boring talk about the false promise of reproducible modeling.

\item \textbf{Regression --- MNF} Notebook as simple machine learning

\item \textbf{Bayes Theorem and Inference --- MNF} Adding context to regression 

\item \textbf{Demo with EAA model --- JDub} run thru Edwards Aquifer modeling workflow?



\item \textbf{Freyberg model --- MNF} Introduce the enhanced Freyberg model.
Show "truth" observations, water budget, etc


\item \textbf{Connecting a model to PEST++ --- RJH} Steady-state GUI Style - how can you connect a model to PEST with a GUI?

\item\textbf{run iES and viz in Excel and python --- RJH} All defaults, uncertainty from the start



\textbf{TUESDAY}

\item \textbf{Adding transience to a model notebook --- JDub/MNF}. flopy/python review

\item \textbf{Intro to pyemu --- JDub/MNF} {show that can start in GUI and flip over to pyemu}

\item \textbf{Geostatistics, the Prior and pilot points --- MNF} Part 1: more on pilot points: Exploring the idea of
a model of spatial correlation (e.g. covariance matrix). Variograms
as a basis for interpolation, the use of factors, \textquotedblleft spatially
weighted averaging\textquotedblright , all this wrapped up in Kriging.
Function for creation and viz. Spectral simulation for unconditional simulation.
What are pilot points? Add storage pilot points low level in pyemu?

\item \textbf{Setup pest interface notebook --- JDub} "what just happened!?".  \textcolor{red}{Excersize: experiment with the 
PstFromFlopy class to setup different pars and obs. competition: who can setup the most parameters?} Think a giant macro that pulls together the various elements have seen to far.


\item \textbf{ WTF is up with transient modeling? --- RJH}. Discussion about the allure and pitfalls
of transient modeling, esp for history-matching.

\item \textbf{Processing obs and setting weights notebook --- JDub}.  Discussion about observation processing

\textbf{WEDNESDAY}

\item \textbf{Prior Monte Carlo --- JDub/RJH}. Do this before even setting obsvals or weights.
mechanics of parallel run mgmt - including giveup setting, pestpp-swp.  The safety of Prior Monte Carlo.
Learning from Prior Monte Carlo. Discuss prior data conflict



\item \textbf{GLM --- MNF} Derivation of the Gauss-Levenberg-Marquardt
Algorithm maths --- walking through the PDF with $\lambda$ images





\item \textbf{PESTPP-GLM part 1 notebook: fill a base Jacobian --- RJH}. Start this then cover FOSM theory

\item \textbf{FOSM theory (including ident and sens) and dataworth --- JDub} FOSM as an alternative to MC (rejection
sampling). PEST lingo = PREDUNC/GENLINPRED.  Posterior residual-based weight adjust and implications.

\item \textbf{Dataworth notebook --- MNF} 

\item \textbf{PESTPP-GLM part 2 notebook --- JDub}. Actual parameter adjustments (scary!) and 
posterior parameter and forecast estimation. {change the forecasts and do more dataworth}


\textbf{THURSDAY}

\item \textbf{Ensemble-based modeling analyses --- JDub}. Considerations for using ensembles.
parameter statistical moment changes instead of "sensitivity analysis".  Visualizing 
obs vs sim. more comprehensive pest interface.  

\item \textbf{PESTPP-IES notebook part 1 --- MNF}

\item \textbf{Localization and PESTPP-IES notebook part 2 --- JDub}

\item \textbf{Prior-data conflict - returning to Prior Monte Carlo --- JDub} Bias-variance tradeoff. Pontification around
the obession with a good fit vs the reality flawed models and noisey data.  Underfitting as a 
strategy to avoid bias.

\item \textbf{PESTPP-IES with PDC activated --- MNF}

\item \textbf{Live Demo: ensemble-based scenario modeling --- JDub} Create a 
scenario model, setup a pest interface and run prior or posterior Monte Carlo (pestpp-swp)

\textbf{FRIDAY}

\item \textbf{Stuff we didn't get to yet}

\item \textbf{Mgmt opt under uncertainty --- MNF}: examples from SIRE and Little Plover

\item \textbf{PESTPP-OPT notebook --- JDub}

\item \textbf{Discussion and wrap up --- ALL}

\end{enumerate}
